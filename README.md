## Project Steps


1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Data was collected from multiple sources on the internet, and Kaggle.
     
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - The acquired data underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing data formats.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Relevant features and attributes were selected for analysis based on their importance and relevance to the project goals. Features such as mileage, price, displacement, fuel type, and dimensions were considered for inclusion in the analysis.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Descriptive statistics, data visualization, and trend analysis were used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

5. **Power BI Report Creation:**
   - The cleaned and analyzed data was visualized using Power BI to create an interactive and informative report. Various charts, graphs, and dashboards were designed to present key findings, trends, and insights in a visually appealing and intuitive manner.

6. **Report Interpretation:**
   - The Power BI report allows users to interactively explore the data, analyze trends, compare different car models, and gain insights into the Indian car market. Users can filter and drill down into the data to uncover valuable insights and make informed decisions.

## Repository
